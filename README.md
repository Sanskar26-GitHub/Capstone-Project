# CYBER PHYSICAL SYSTEM USING ARDUINO

OBJECTIVE
In the rapidly evolving landscape of healthcare, there is a growing need for innovative solutions that leverage Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to enhance patient care,monitoring, and management. The purpose of this project is to design and implement a CPS using Arduino for healthcare applications, focusing on real-time health monitoring and data analysis.

Motivation: The motivation behind developing a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) for healthcare using Arduino stems from the desire to leverage technology to improve healthcare outcomes, enhance patient monitoring, and streamline healthcare processes.

A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) with Arduino in healthcare offers enhanced patient monitoring and management. Arduino's low-cost, open-source platform facilitates real-time data acquisition from medical sensors, ensuring timely and accurate health information. This system enables continuous remote monitoring of vital signs, and chronic conditions, promoting proactive healthcare. With seamless connectivity, healthcare providers can remotely assess patient status, improving response times and reducing hospitalizations. Additionally, Arduino-based CPS fosters innovation in wearable devices and smart health applications, empowering individuals to actively participate in their well-being. Overall, this technology enhances healthcare efficiency, accessibility, and patient outcomes in a cost effective manner.
